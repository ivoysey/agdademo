* **foldrl-simpler.agda**

  all the proofs that i did in RG, but just as agda without much
  explanation about what's going on. it also includes a proof that if you
  have an f at `A -> A -> A` that's associative and commutative, that
  implies that it has the Î” property

* **foldrl.agda**

  the same whole work up, but with the version of the proof that invoves
  `rev` before I noticed that I didn't need to make the detour

* **live-23-feb.agda**

   what I wrote live in RG

* **patter.md**

  the script / notes that i worked up for myself in getting ready for
  RG.
